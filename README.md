# Global App Testing - dev task 

## Goal of project

The goal of this project is to prepare a web crawler for any page you want and map it in python code. 
There is plenty of solution for crawling between the pages but I wanted prepatr some unique approach of this problem
in the easy way without complicated structures and unecessary features. Idea for this project was from one of the 
interview tasks [Global App Testing dev task - senior python developer](https://gitlab.com/GlobalAppTesting/public-recruitment-tests/gat-senior-python-engineer-dev-task).
I hope you will enjoy this project, feel free to contribute and create issues - all of us want a good quality code and 
everybody are allowedd to make mistakes.
